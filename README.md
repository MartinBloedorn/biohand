Files and documentation for the Biohand project. 

**Note**: the files will be uploaded as soon as the first version of the prototype is completed, around the beginning of sep/2015. In the meantime, you can follow the development of the prototype in [my personal page](http://martinvb.com) or in  [Hackday](https://hackaday.io/project/6411-biohand-low-cost-3d-printed-hand-prosthesis).
